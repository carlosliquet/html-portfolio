<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr></hr>

<h3>CREED</h3>
<p>This is my favorite motivational moovie, 
    I think that is the form what every MAN need 
    FIGHT for self DEMONS.</p>

<h3>The Kissing Booth</h3>
<p>This is my favorite romantic moovie, Is not exactly for the actor or escenes, is 
    something about what im leaving 
    in the moment I'm discover that film.</p>

<h3>UNDERRATED</h3>
<p>This is my favorite documentary film, the life for STEPHEN CURRY 
    is a real example about is not
    what you can do, is what GOD can do in YOU.</p>
